// New Rendering Method=>

        {/* <React.StrictMode> */}
            <App />
        {/* </React.StrictMode> */}
    </Provider>,

// Outdated method of rendering=>

// ReactDOM.render(
//     // Now, any React components that call useSelector or useDispatch will be talking to the Redux store we gave to the <Provider>.
//     <Provider store ={store}> 
//         <App />
//     </Provider>, 
//     document.getElementById('root')
